# PenSLR-dataset

Welcome to the README for the PenSLR-dataset repository. This README provides an overview of the dataset structure and its contents.

## Structure

The dataset is organized into two main folders:

- **`dataset1-3`**: Contains samples of up to 3-word sentences from 16 commonly used Persian Sign Language (PSL) glosses. Each subject is represented by a separate folder.

  - **`Subject1`**
  - **`Subject2`**
  - **`Subject3`**
  - **`Subject4`**
  - **`Subject5`**

- **`dataset4-8`**: Contains samples of 4 to 8-word sentences from the same 16 glosses. Similar to the `dataset1-3`, each subject is represented by a separate folder.

  - **`Subject1`**
  - **`Subject2`**
  - **`Subject3`**
  - **`Subject4`**
  - **`Subject5`**

## Dataset Summary

The PenSLR dataset has been curated to assess the effectiveness of the PenSLR system. It comprises over 3000 samples from 16 commonly used PSL glosses. The dataset was collected with the assistance of 5 volunteers, and it includes sentences of up to 3 words from the selected glosses.

Additionally, another dataset was gathered to evaluate the model's ability to recognize longer sentences. This dataset contains samples of sentences ranging from 4 to 8 words.

## Example

As an illustration of the dataset structure and content, consider the following example file:

**File Path:** `dataset1-3/Subject1/AbiAst.txt`

**Description:** This file contains samples recorded by Subject1 for the sentence "Abi Ast" which translates to "Is Blue" in English. Each sample in this file is separated by a semicolon (;).


## Acknowledgements

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the five dedicated volunteers whose invaluable contributions were pivotal in the recording and collection of the dataset. Their unwavering commitment and passion significantly enriched our project, ensuring its success and enabling advancements in Persian Sign Language recognition research.
